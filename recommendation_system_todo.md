## Recommendation System Development To-Do List

This list outlines the phases, tasks, and subtasks involved in building a robust recommendation system, with specific considerations for a TypeScript codebase, and includes related cron job implementations.

### I. Phase 1: Requirements Gathering & Analysis

**Goal:** Clearly define what the recommendation system should achieve and how it will operate.

*   **A. Define System Goals & Scope**
    *   Identify the primary objective (e.g., increase user engagement, boost sales, improve content discovery).
    *   Determine what will be recommended (e.g., listings, users, categories).
    *   Define the context of recommendations (e.g., "similar to this listing," "listings you might like," "trending listings").
    *   Establish the initial scope (e.g., MVP features vs. future enhancements).
*   **B. Identify Data Sources**
    *   **User Interaction Data:**
        *   Clicks/Views (e.g., `listings` table, analytics events).
        *   Purchases/Transactions (e.g., `transactions` table).
        *   Likes/Favorites (if applicable).
        *   Search queries.
    *   **Item/Content Data:**
        *   Listing attributes (e.g., category, price, location, description, images).
        *   User profiles (e.g., demographics, past activity).
    *   **External Data (if applicable):**
        *   Public datasets for initial model training.
*   **C. Define User Stories & Use Cases**
    *   As a `[User Type]`, I want to `[Action]`, so that `[Benefit]`.
    *   Example: "As a buyer, I want to see recommended listings similar to ones I've viewed, so I can easily find more items I might be interested in."
*   **D. Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
    *   **Engagement:** Click-through rate (CTR) on recommendations, time spent on recommended items.
    *   **Conversion:** Conversion rate from recommended items to purchase/action.
    *   **Diversity:** How varied are the recommendations?
    *   **Novelty:** How often are new items recommended?
    *   **Relevance:** User surveys, implicit feedback.

### II. Phase 2: Design & Architecture

**Goal:** Plan the system's structure, data flow, and technical components.

*   **A. Data Model Design**
    *   **Recommendation Data:**
        *   Determine if new database tables are needed (e.g., `user_item_interactions`, `recommendation_cache`).
        *   Define schema for storing processed features.
    *   **TypeScript Interfaces/Types:**
        *   Create `lib/recommendations/types.ts` for all data structures:
            *   `UserInteraction` interface.
            *   `ListingFeature` interface.
            *   `RecommendationRequest` interface (for API input).
            *   `RecommendationResponse` interface (for API output).
            *   `RecommendationItem` interface.
*   **B. System Architecture**
    *   **Data Pipeline:**
        *   How will raw data be collected, cleaned, and transformed into features? (e.g., batch processing, streaming).
        *   Consider using existing `lib/` utilities or creating new ones.
    *   **Recommendation Engine:**
        *   Where will the core recommendation logic reside? (e.g., `lib/recommendations/`).
        *   Will it be a simple rule-based system, collaborative filtering, content-based, or a hybrid?
        *   Consider using external ML libraries or services.
    *   **Serving Layer:**
        *   How will recommendations be generated and served in real-time? (e.g., pre-computed, on-demand).
*   **C. Algorithm Selection & Strategy**
    *   Research and select initial recommendation algorithms (e.g., item-to-item collaborative filtering, content-based filtering using listing descriptions, popularity-based).
    *   Define how the model will be trained and updated.
*   **D. API Design (`app/api/recommendations/route.ts`)**
    *   Define API endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/recommendations?userId=...&context=...`).
    *   Specify request parameters and response format (using defined TypeScript interfaces).
    *   Consider authentication and authorization for the API.
*   **E. Infrastructure Planning**
    *   Determine compute resources needed for data processing and model serving.
    *   Consider storage for processed data and models.

### III. Phase 3: Development & Implementation

**Goal:** Build the components of the recommendation system and related background tasks.

*   **A. Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline (`lib/recommendations/data_processor.ts`)**
    *   Implement scripts/functions to extract raw data from `transactions`, `listings`, etc.
    *   Clean and preprocess data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize data).
    *   Perform feature engineering (e.g., create user-item interaction matrices, extract text features from descriptions).
    *   **TypeScript:** Ensure all data transformations are strongly typed.
*   **B. Recommendation Engine Development (`lib/recommendations/engine.ts`)**
    *   Implement the chosen recommendation algorithm(s).
    *   Develop functions for training the model (if applicable).
    *   Develop functions for generating recommendations based on input features.
    *   **TypeScript:** Define clear function signatures and return types.
*   **C. API Endpoint Implementation (`app/api/recommendations/route.ts`)**
    *   Implement the API route to receive requests.
    *   Call the recommendation engine to generate recommendations.
    *   Format the response according to the defined `RecommendationResponse` interface.
    *   Handle loading states, errors, and empty recommendation lists in the UI.
    *   **TypeScript:** Use `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` types, and ensure request/response bodies conform to interfaces.
*   **D. Frontend Integration (`components/recommendations/RecommendationList.tsx`)**
    *   Create React components to display recommendations (e.g., `RecommendationCard`, `RecommendationCarousel`).
    *   Integrate with the new API endpoint to fetch recommendations.
    *   Handle loading states, errors, and empty recommendation lists in the UI.
    *   **TypeScript:** Define `props` interfaces for all components.
*   **E. Database Schema Implementation (if new tables needed)**
    *   Write SQL migration scripts for any new tables (e.g., `user_item_interactions`, `recommendation_cache`).
    *   Ensure these schemas align with your TypeScript data models.
*   **F. Implement Transaction Monitoring Cron Job (using `pg_cron`)**
    *   **Purpose:** Periodically check for transactions stuck in `pending` or `failed` states that require attention, or discrepancies between `transactions` and `webhook_events`.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Design SQL queries to identify problematic transactions (e.g., `status = 'pending'` for > X hours, `status = 'completed'` but service not fulfilled).
        *   Write PL/pgSQL function to execute these checks.
        *   Integrate with an alerting system (e.g., send email, log to Sentry/monitoring dashboard).
        *   Schedule the `pg_cron` job (e.g., every 15 minutes).
*   **G. Implement Listing Activation/Deactivation Cron Job (using `pg_cron`)**
    *   **Purpose:** Automatically activate or deactivate listings based on their `featured_until` date, payment status, or other time-based criteria.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Design SQL queries to find listings that need activation/deactivation.
        *   Write PL/pgSQL function to update `listings` table (e.g., set `is_featured = FALSE` if `featured_until` is past).
        *   Schedule the `pg_cron` job (e.g., daily or hourly).

### IV. Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation

**Goal:** Verify the system's correctness, performance, and effectiveness.

*   **A. Unit & Integration Testing**
    *   Write unit tests for data processing functions, recommendation algorithms, and API logic.

    *   **TypeScript:** Leverage Jest/Vitest with TypeScript for robust testing.
*   **B. Data Validation**
    *   Verify the quality and integrity of the data used for training and inference.
    *   Ensure data pipeline outputs match expected types and formats.
*   **C. Model Evaluation (if using ML)**
    *   Use appropriate metrics (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-score, Mean Average Precision) to evaluate model performance offline.
    *   Perform A/B testing to measure the impact of recommendations on user behavior (KPIs).
*   **D. End-to-End Testing**
    *   Test the entire flow from user interaction on the frontend to recommendation display.
*   **E. Performance & Load Testing**
    *   Simulate high traffic to the recommendation API to ensure it scales.

*   **A. Environment Setup**
    *   Configure production environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connections).
*   **B. CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
    *   Automate testing, building, and deployment of the recommendation system components.
*   **C. Deployment Strategy**
    *   Deploy the backend API, frontend components, and any data processing jobs.
    *   Consider blue/green or canary deployments for minimal disruption.

### VI. Phase 6: Monitoring, Maintenance & Iteration

**Goal:** Ensure the system remains healthy, performs well, and continuously improves.

*   **A. Monitoring & Alerting**
    *   Set up dashboards to track KPIs, API performance, and system health.
    *   Configure alerts for anomalies (e.g., high error rates, low recommendation coverage).
    *   **Monitor Cron Jobs:** Ensure `pg_cron` jobs are running successfully and on schedule. Set up alerts for job failures or long execution times for transaction monitoring and listing activation jobs.
*   **B. Performance Optimization**
    *   Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of the data pipeline, recommendation engine, and API.
*   **C. Feedback Loop Implementation**
    *   Capture user interactions with recommendations (clicks, purchases) and feed them back into the data pipeline for future model training.
*   **D. Model Retraining & Updates**
    *   Establish a schedule for retraining the recommendation model with fresh data.
    *   Plan for deploying updated models with minimal disruption.
