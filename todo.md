## Admin Dashboard - Missing Functionality TODO

Based on the current codebase and common admin dashboard functionalities, here are some potentially missing important functionalities:

### 1. Comprehensive User Management
- **User Details View:** Implement a dedicated page to view and edit individual user profiles (beyond just banning/unbanning). This should include details like full name, email, phone, location, registration date, last login, and potentially a history of their actions.
- **Password Reset/Management:** Add the ability for administrators to initiate password resets for users.
- **Role Assignment/Editing:** Enhance the role management view to allow direct assignment of roles to users from their detailed profile page.
- **User Activity Logs:** Implement tracking of user logins, listing creations, messages sent, etc., for auditing and troubleshooting.

### 2. Advanced Listing Moderation
- **Detailed Listing View:** Expand the current "View" button functionality to a more comprehensive view with all listing details, images, and potentially a history of moderation actions.
- **Bulk Actions:** Add the ability to approve, reject, or delete multiple listings at once.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Implement more advanced filtering (by status, category, user, date) and sorting options for listings.
- **Reporting/Flagging Management:** If users can report listings, develop a system to review and act on those reports.

### 3. Content Management
- **Category/Subcategory Management:** Implement the ability to add, edit, or delete categories and subcategories directly from the admin panel.
- **Plan Management:** Implement the ability to add, edit, or delete payment plans.

### 4. System Configuration
- **General Settings:** Add functionality for managing site-wide settings like contact information, terms of service, privacy policy, etc.
- **Email Templates:** Implement an interface for editing templates for transactional emails (e.g., welcome, password reset, listing approved).

### 5. Notifications and Alerts
- **Admin Notifications:** Develop a system to alert administrators about new listings, user reports, failed payments, etc.
- **System Health Monitoring:** Implement basic monitoring of server health, database performance, etc.

### 6. Analytics and Reporting (Beyond Current)
- **More Granular Analytics:** Provide deeper insights into user engagement, listing performance (views, clicks), search trends, etc., beyond daily new users/listings.
- **Revenue Reporting:** Implement detailed breakdown of revenue by plan, payment method, and time period.

### 7. Security Features
- **Admin Activity Logs:** Implement tracking of actions performed by administrators for auditing purposes.
- **Admin Role Permissions:** Implement more granular control over what each admin role can access or modify.
